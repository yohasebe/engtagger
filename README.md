# EngTagger

English Part-of-Speech Tagger Library; a Ruby port of Lingua::EN::Tagger

### Description

A Ruby port of Perl Lingua::EN::Tagger, a probability based, corpus-trained 
tagger that assigns POS tags to English text based on a lookup dictionary and 
a set of probability values. The tagger assigns appropriate tags based on 
conditional probabilities--it examines the preceding tag to determine the 
appropriate tag for the current word. Unknown words are classified according to 
word morphology or can be set to be treated as nouns or other parts of speech.  
The tagger also extracts as many nouns and noun phrases as it can, using a set 
of regular expressions.

### Features

* Assigns POS tags to English text
* Extract noun phrases from tagged text
* etc.

### Synopsis:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'engtagger'

    # Create a parser object
    tgr = EngTagger.new

    # Sample text
    text = "Alice chased the big fat cat."

    # Add part-of-speech tags to text
    tagged = tgr.add_tags(text)

    #=> "<nnp>Alice</nnp> <vbd>chased</vbd> <det>the</det> <jj>big</jj> <jj>fat</jj><nn>cat</nn> <pp>.</pp>"
  
    # Get a list of all nouns and noun phrases with occurrence counts
    word_list = tgr.get_words(text)

    #=> {"Alice"=>1, "cat"=>1, "fat cat"=>1, "big fat cat"=>1}
  
    # Get a readable version of the tagged text
    readable = tgr.get_readable(text)
  
    #=> "Alice/NNP chased/VBD the/DET big/JJ fat/JJ cat/NN ./PP"

    # Get all nouns from a tagged output
    nouns = tgr.get_nouns(tagged)
  
    #=> {"cat"=>1, "Alice"=>1}

    # Get all proper nouns
    proper = tgr.get_proper_nouns(tagged)

    #=> {"Alice"=>1}

    # Get all past tense verbs
    pt_verbs = tgr.get_past_tense_verbs(tagged)

    #=> {"chased"=>1}

    # Get all the adjectives
    adj = tgr.get_adjectives(tagged)

    #=> {"big"=>1, "fat"=>1}

    # Get all noun phrases of any syntactic level
    # (same as word_list but take a tagged input)
    nps = tgr.get_noun_phrases(tagged)

    #=> {"Alice"=>1, "cat"=>1, "fat cat"=>1, "big fat cat"=>1}

### Tag Set

The set of POS tags used here is a modified version of the Penn Treebank tagset. Tags with non-letter characters have been redefined to work better in our data structures. Also, the "Determiner" tag (DET) has been changed from 'DT', in order to avoid confusion with the HTML tag, `<DT>`.
